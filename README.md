# Introduction 

Although centralized exchanges [CEXs](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-are-centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges/) currently dominate cryptocurrency trading activity, decentralized exchanges [DEXs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralizedmarket.asp) are growing in popularity. DEXs facilitate peer-to-peer trading by relying on automated smart contracts to execute trades without an intermediary.
Decentralized exchanges take a different approach to buying and selling digital assets: They operate without an intermediary organization for clearing transactions, relying instead on self-executing smart contracts to facilitate trading. This dynamic enables instantaneous trades, often at a lower cost than on centralized crypto exchanges.

To put it simply, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) enable users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with one another without the need for brokers. Users merely need to connect their crypto wallet to a DEX, such as Uniswap [CRYPTO:UNI](https://uniswap.org/) or PancakeSwap [CRYPTO:CAKE](https://pancakeswap.finance/), select their crypto-crypto trading pair of choice, such as between Bitcoin and Ethereum, enter the amount, and hit the swap button. 

In this project we have made an attempt to exactly do that, create a decentralized exchange platform.
